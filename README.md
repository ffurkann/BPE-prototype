# BPE-prototype

A pure-Python, from-scratch Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer prototype for educational use and experimentation.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a minimal BPE trainer that:
- Counts adjacent symbol pairs in a corpus  
- Merges the most frequent pair iteratively  
- Tracks merge history and builds a token â†” ID map  

Ideal for learning how BPE works under the hood. Not optimized for large corpora or production use.
